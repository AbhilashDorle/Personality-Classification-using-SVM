# Personality-Classification-using-SVM

Discovering your own individuality or self-discovery has been with the philosophers and poets for a long time. Several face recognition models have been proposed and several are under study. A part of the project was identify personality types according to the shape of the person. The shape of a person and the associated personality has been classified according to Mien Shiang a technique to identify the personality according to the shape of the face of a person. This is according to the book “Face Reader by Patrician McCarthy”
A quick study of every face can be made to determine the person’s basic nature, character, honesty, self-confidence, leadership abilities, stamina, loyalty and potential. This information is tailored on a person faces and few other characteristics. The nuances are suggested to be measured and studied. These subtleties have generalized from vast experiences
An attempt to understand the strategies described in the book and implement them using machine learning techniques was the objective. The development of such a system would require good quality images which are usually difficult to find. We may therefore not find the classification to be accurate. 

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The initial problem was that of categorization, according to the shape of an individuals face. This categorization was mapped according to the guidelines mentioned in the book. 
The book in accordance with the technique “Mieng Shiang” have plotted various face shape with personalities, this has been done with years of experience inculcated into the technique. As an instance given in the book, a person with rectangular face shape has anger as their predominant emotion. 
The principles of Mieng Shiang have been an ancient art that was used by the Chinese people. These principles were formed on the basis of experience of several people, which were then generalized in to the guidelines.
then its hyperplanes are the 2-dimensional planes, while if the space is 2-dimensional, its hyperplane are the 1-dimensional lines. 
                                         
    
The dataset used by us in the project consists of five various types:
a.	Heart shaped
b.	Oblong shaped
c.	Oval shaped
d.	Round shaped
e.	Square shaped
These shapes have been classified with accordance to the principles mentioned in the book. 

The classification algorithm used was “One vs rest”. It is used for classification for more than two classes. 
SVM was employed to perform the classification
